We believe that all aspects of the MiniJava specification are implemented and functional in our compiler. We did not add
any extensions not explicitly mentioned in the MiniJava specification.

We corrected portions of the semantic analysis visitor that we had incorrectly implemented in the previous phase.
Outside of this, we decided to reimplement our dependency checker from the ground up as a separate visitor, which we
deemed necessary to properly build the vtables and to achieve O(1) dispatch timing. This proved to be useful, as it
helped us later on in the phase as we were able to use it to allocate memory using the dependency graph as we tracked
what fields were defined by a given class as well as those that it may have inherited from its parent class. This helped
solve a serious issue we encountered where we were not allocating enough memory for each object, and as a result, were
overwriting existing data in memory.

We were not able to get correct code generation for LinkedList.java and TreeVisitor.java. After working for around 20 hours
before 12/3, we put in 10 hours of work, allowing us to fix many problems we had. However, we did not have time to fix
these errors. Not due the time constraint, but rather due to the fact that we are both mentally exhausted.
