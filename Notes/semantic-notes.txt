We made no additional checks or extensions outside of the requirements described in the semantics specification.

We made slight changes to the previous portions of the project (AST) during the our work on the semantic piece. We added
an exit value to the Program AST node, which allows us to exit MiniJava properly if any errors occur during the type-checking
pass over the global symbol table. We also added the package "TypeNode", which allowed us to gather the real types of
nodes in the AST. We also had to add a missed grammar piece from the parser portion (in minijava.cup).
